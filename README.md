## 1. What is a query in SQLite?

In SQLite, a query is a request for data retrieval or manipulation from one or more tables in a database. It allows you to filter, sort, calculate, and summarize data based on specific criteria.

## 2. How do you create a basic select query in SQLite?

To create a select query in SQLite, you can use the SELECT statement. Here's an example:

```sql
SELECT column1, column2 FROM tableName;
```

## 3. What is a parameterized query in SQLite?

A parameterized query in SQLite allows you to pass dynamic values as parameters into your query. It helps prevent SQL injection and provides flexibility. Here's an example:

```sql
SELECT column1, column2 FROM tableName WHERE column1 = ?;
```

## 4. How can you calculate a field's value in a SQLite query?

You can use calculated fields in SQLite queries to perform calculations on existing data or combine multiple fields. Here's an example that calculates the total price based on unit price and quantity:

```sql
SELECT productName, unitPrice, quantity, (unitPrice * quantity) AS totalPrice FROM tableName;
```

## 5. What is a join in SQLite?

In SQLite, a join combines records from two or more tables based on a related column between them. It allows you to retrieve data from multiple tables simultaneously. Here's an example of an inner join:

```sql
SELECT column1, column2 FROM table1 INNER JOIN table2 ON table1.column = table2.column;
```

## 6. What is a subquery in SQLite?

A subquery in SQLite is a query nested inside another query. It is used to retrieve data based on the results of an inner query. Here's an example:

```sql
SELECT column1, column2 FROM tableName WHERE column1 IN (SELECT column1 FROM subTable);
```

## 7. How do you sort query results in ascending or descending order in SQLite?

To sort query results in SQLite, you can use the ORDER BY clause followed by the column name and the keywords ASC (ascending) or DESC (descending). Here's an example:

```sql
SELECT columnName FROM tableName ORDER BY columnName ASC;
```

## 8. What is a wildcard character in SQLite queries?

In SQLite, a wildcard character is a special symbol used in query patterns to match one or more characters. The percentage sign (%) represents multiple characters, and the underscore (_) represents a single character.

## 9. How do you use a wildcard in a SQLite query?

You can use the LIKE operator along with wildcard characters to filter data based on specific patterns in SQLite. Here's an example:

```sql
SELECT columnName FROM tableName WHERE columnName LIKE 'A%';
```

## 10. What is a limit query in SQLite?

A limit query in SQLite allows you to restrict the number of records returned by a query. It is used to retrieve a specific number of rows. Here's an example:

```sql
SELECT columnName FROM tableName LIMIT 10;
```

## 11. How do you perform grouping and aggregate functions in SQLite?

In SQLite, you can use the GROUP BY clause along with aggregate functions such as SUM, COUNT, AVG, etc., to perform calculations on grouped data. Here's an example:

```sql
SELECT column1, SUM(column2) FROM tableName GROUP BY column1;
```

## 12. What is the difference between UNION and UNION ALL in SQLite?

UNION and UNION ALL are used to combine the results of two or more SELECT statements in SQLite. The difference is that UNION removes duplicate rows from the result set, while UNION ALL retains all rows, including duplicates.

## 13. How do you perform a cross join in SQLite?

A cross join, also known as a Cartesian join, in SQLite combines every row from the first table with every row from the second table. Here's an example:

```sql
SELECT * FROM table1 CROSS JOIN table2;
```
